## Features

 - High performance (developed using a profiler)
 - Lightweight and high-quality codebase (following `PSR-0,1,4`)
 - Secure `PRNG` implementation (64-Bit support)
 - OOP facade to PHP core functionality
 - PHP 7.0 & HHVM ready
 - Stable, clean + well documented code
 - Unit-tested with a good coverage


## Example

Generate random number between 1 and 10 with `OpenSSL` random bytes (library default):
```php
$generator = new Clickalicious\Rng\Generator();
$number    = $generator->generate(1, 10);
echo $number;
```

Generate random number between 1 and 10 with `MCrypt` random bytes:
```php
$generator = new Clickalicious\Rng\Generator(Clickalicious\Rng\Generator::MODE_MCRYPT);
$number    = $generator->generate(1, 10);
echo $number;
```

### Visualization

You can create a visualization of randomization (as you can see below but larger size) through `Visual.php` (the file is located in root).

## Requirements

 - `PHP >= 5.4` (compatible up to version 5.6 as well as 7.x and HHVM)


## Philosophy

This library provides a state of the art `PRNG` (**P**seudo **R**andom **N**umber **G**enerator) implementation to generate secure `Pseudo Random Numbers` with PHP. The generation is either based on `Open SSL` or `MCrypt` or as fallback on PHP's internal functionality. The library provides a good `Seed generator` on puplic API.


## Versioning

For a consistent versioning i decided to make use of `Semantic Versioning 2.0.0` http://semver.org. Its easy to understand, very common and known from many other software projects.


## Roadmap

- [x] Target stable release `1.0.0`
- [ ] `>= 90%` test coverage
- [x] Better visualization
- [x] Integrate polyfill
- [ ] Security check through 3rd-Party (Please get in contact with me)

## Security Issues

If you encounter a (potential) security issue don't hesitate to get in contact with us `opensource@clickalicious.de` before releasing it to the public. So i get a chance to prepare and release an update before the issue is getting shared. Thank you!


## Participate & Share

... yeah. If you're a code monkey too - maybe we can build a force ;) If you would like to participate in either **Code**, **Comments**, **Documentation**, **Wiki**, **Bug-Reports**, **Unit-Tests**, **Bug-Fixes**, **Feedback** and/or **Critic** then please let me know as well!
